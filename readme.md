# Droplet
## About
Droplet is a simple n-body gravitation simulator.

## Goals
- Learn about n-body simulations
- Improve my Python and Typescript skills
- Improve my physics knowledge
- Implement Barnes-Hut space partitioning

## Current Features
- Gravitational attraction between bodies
- Force-softening to prevent singularities
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Adjustable number of bodies
- Adjustable body attributes
- Adjustable fundamental constants

## Planned Features
- Barnes-Hut space partitioning
- Better force-softening
- Runtime body creation
